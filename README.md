## Introduction  
LiDAR and IMU are among the widely used sensors in the field of self-driving cars and robotics. To fuse both sensors and use them for algorithms (such as SLAM), it is essential to obtain the exact extrinsic parameter.  

Inspired by [Deephome/Awesome-LiDAR-Camera-Calibration](https://github.com/Deephome/Awesome-LiDAR-Camera-Calibration), this repository summarizes the LiDAR-IMU calibration methods currently being studied in research fields and related toolboxes.
